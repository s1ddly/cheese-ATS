# Hi and Welcome to cheese-ATS
This repo houses keywords to be used in resumes, they are grouped into their respective technologies.
There is a specific way to use these, basically copy and paste them into an innocuous section of your resume(as white text on a white background for example, in 1pt font size)
The concept here is that when ATS runs on the resume, it will pick up all the keywords.

Example of usage of this list below:

Ths is a corner of my resume, the text is unreadable on the bottom right unless highlighted, and it contains all the keywords in this repo.
